    <h3>Description : </h3>
    <p>This homemade ice cream is easy to make with just 4 ingredients: pure vanilla extract, milk, heavy whipping cream, and sugar. This American or Philadelphia-style ice cream makes for a brighter, more pronounced vanilla flavor.</p>
    <br><h3>Ingredients : </h3><br>
    <ul class="unl">
        <li>Milk: This homemade vanilla ice cream starts with 2 Â¼ cups of milk. 
            <li>Heavy whipping cream: A cup of heavy whipping cream comes next.
                <li>   Sugar: White sugar sweetens things up. 
                    <li> Vanilla: Two teaspoons of vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor. 
            
</ul><br>
<h3>Steps : </h3>
<br><ol class="orl">
<li>Stir milk, cream, and sugar in a saucepan over low heat until sugar has dissolved. Heat just until the mixture is hot and a small ring of foam appears around the edge.
    <li>Transfer cream mixture to a pourable container such as a large measuring cup. Stir in vanilla extract and chill mix thoroughly, at least 2 hours. (Overnight is best.)

    </li>
    <li>
        Pour cold ice cream mix into an ice cream maker, turn on the machine, and churn according to manufacturer's directions, 20 to 25 minutes.


    </li>
<li>When ice cream is softly frozen, serve immediately or place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the ice cream and place in the freezer to ripen, 2 to 3 hours.</li>
